# Photons in the process...

During teleportation an initial photon which carries the polarization that is to be transffered and one pair of entangled photons are subjected
to a measurement such that the second photon of the entangled pair acquires the polarization of the initial photon.

This is the title variable: **{{page.title}}**

## Electrons in the process...

In quantum entanglement the properties of one particle (the electron) affect the properties of another, even when seperated by a large distance. 

### Subsection heading (h3)

The particulars of your body copy will be determined by the topic of your page. Regardless of topic, it’s a good practice to follow the inverted pyramid structure when writing copy: Begin with the information that’s most important to your users and then present information of less importance.

Keep each section and subsection focused — a good approach is to include one theme (topic) per section.

#### Subsection heading (h4)

Use the side navigation menu to help your users quickly skip to different sections of your page. The menu is best suited to displaying a hierarchy with one to three levels and, as we mentioned, to display the sub-navigation of a given page.
